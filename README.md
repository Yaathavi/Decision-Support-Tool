# Decision-Support-Tool

This tool is based on Excel and it is very easy to use. Simply click on the buttons, which have descriptions on them and then fill out the user-forms with the appropriate information. Upon submitting your userform, the information will be displayed in an organized fashion and you will have the option to sort your entries based on different criteria.

If you want to see the VBA code that was used to create this project,

1. Open the file on Excel
2. Enable Macros
3. Go to the Developer Tab (If you don't see it, go to Options -> Customize Ribbon -> Main Tabs -> select Developer check box)
4. Click "View Code" on the Developer Tab

(This tool is only compatible with the Windows Operating System as MacOs tends to have some issues with VBA) 

The purpose of this product is to make important information more accessible to our client in a singular application. By providing tools such as centralized note-taking tools, task tracker, and resource page, the client is able to increase efficiency and productivity within their company. This tool tackles the problem of disorganization, since the client is using many tools to stay organized and has a hard time navigating through different applications. By providing a singular application with the same functionality, the client saves valuable time. 

When you first open the file, you will be directed to the main page that gives a brief description of each sheet and its purpose. It also has a home button that allows the client to navigate to other parts of the tool. Here are some pictures of the tool:

The other 2 spreadhseets (Meeting Reminders & Note Taking) have a similar lay-out with similar functionality, but a different purpose.

The Meeting Reminders sheet is intended to keep track of emails the client wants to send in the future and reminds client on day of. 
The Note Taking sheet keeps track of notes taken during meetings and allows the client to edit it later.

> **Project Summary**

During my first semester of university, I took a course called Management Sciences (MSCI 100) and I was placed in a team of 5 to develop a decision support tool using **Microsoft Excel** and **VBA** for a client. Our client was a fourth-year engineering student seeking an organization-based tool that would improve his team's workflow and efficiency in completing their Final Year Design Project. 

Within the team, I was in charge of overseeing the project and making sure everyone knew what to do and when to do it by. I spent time formatting the tool to give it a consistent design, tested and modified the tool after completion to ensure there were no bugs/errors and then I later created a 5-min video regarding the tool's functionality. Along with building the tool, my team and I wrote thorough documentation of the tool which included design specifications, test specifications, user manuals, and project-plan updates.
